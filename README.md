## intro.

Your mission is to use your keyboard to control the **EzKew** aliens to swimming across the sea. You'll gain `+1` victory point every second passes through. But don't let your alien get hurt by the fishes. They will decrease your heath point (the number among the alien). You can increase your heath point by hitting the mashmallow

This will give you `+5` victory point and `+1` heath. But notice that your maximum heath point is `2`. The game will over when your heath point is `0` and you get hurt by fish.



Hit `W` or `Up` to move the alien up.

Hit `S` or `Down` to move the alien down.

Hit `A` or `Left` to move the alien left.

Hit `D` or `Right` to move the alien right.



> Tips : you can press `Space` key for a while to see your alien speed up. This effect is limited in about 1.5 second. After that, your alien will use it's normal velocity. To speed up the alien again, press `Space` for a while again.
